# This is Unofficial multiplayer patch for Calamity Infernum.
The changes have been made below. (list may be continued, may be not)
1. Lost Colosseum portal now works in multiplayer lobby. If portal is active and player stay near, he will teleport (well, this is how it should works in vanilla, but it doesn't)
2. Devourer of Gods has strict delay between passive and aggressive modes. It fix situations where DoG attacks you during third laser attack.
